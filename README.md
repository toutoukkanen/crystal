# Crystal Inc.

An unkown tale of the dark secrets of Crystal.

Crystal is a web project that tells a story. It tells about almost godlike powers that technology has achieved. 
It also tells what possibilities and problems could arise when dealing with technology of that magnitude.
But the story is not a book. It cannot be unraveled with just a few simple clicks. This is a challenge!
The player has to find out new user credentials to advance to the next level. Each level has new documents that reveal the dark secrets of Crystal or puzzles leading to new credentials.

There are multiple accounts protected by SHA-224 password hashing and they can be accessed by solving simple or hard puzzles.

The accounts have access to multiple documents that are encrypted by AES-256 cryptographic algorithm. 
This ensures that cheating won't be as easy as just finding the files and reading the content directly.
