        Derium has been the first of its kind in many scientific areas.
        Many of its properties are still a topic of debate. 
        Unanimous theories are yet to be published.
        This document only handles the point of view of the undersigned.<br><br><br>

        <b>Description</b><br>
        Derium is a programmable matter that reacts strongly to electromagnetic phenomenoms.
        Electromagnetic manipulation can lead derium to alter its properties significantly.
        Derium has been observed to be capable of changing its own shape and size, density, mass and color.
        Derium can be "programmed" to achieve these kind of changes trough precise changes in an electric field.


        <br><br>

        Derium can form quantum links with other matter in the [REDACTED].
        This can be achieved through high speed colliding of derium particles.
        The reason is unkown. The quantum links enable derium to harness more energy
        from the [REDACTED]. This can help the matter to either stabilize or overload which varies greatly
        on the state of the matter.

        <br><br>
        
        Derium has been observed to stabilize and even dissipate completely if left alone.
        When derium stabilizes it loses its energy density and quantum links can close.
        This can lead derium matter to crystallize and lose its energy.
        This stabilization is estimated to be the lack of motion because derium
        can only create new quantum links when moving at speeds above six (6) litres/minute.
