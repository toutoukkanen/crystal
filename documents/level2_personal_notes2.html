        <i>Dr. Wells</i><br><br>

        It was an accident.<br>
        Prof. Jones was found in LAB 4.<br>
        It seems that [REDACTED] was used at the highest capacity possible.<br>
        <i>Everything</i> was completely destroyed along him. Poor man.<br>
        Everyone is scared now. How are we supposed to work with this thing?
