        Testing has proved that derium can be controlled by precise electromagnetic manipulation.
        Derium can be <i>programmed</i> to change its own properties.<br><br>

        There are two notable procedures that can change derium's properties. 
        The first is allowing derium to harness more energy to itself.
        This increases its energy density which means more potential.
        If the energy density is too high, derium's structure cannot support itself anymore.
        This can lead to derium criticality which can result in [REDACTED].<br><br>

        If derium is not supported with a continuous flow with energy, it can stabilize.
        This leads to derium crystallization and there are yet to be practical applications to these crystals.<br><br>
        
        Second way to alter derium is to program it through electromagnetic manipulation.
        Precisely altering the molecyle structure can lead
        to metallic bonding. This metallic derium always has the characteristics of chromium. 
        Notable properties are silver-like color, greatly increased density and strong composition.
        This derium metal has proven to be a great alternative to traditional metals because it can be created solely from derium which is renewable.
        It must the noted that the metallic condition doesn't last long as the derium requires energy to stay in that form.
