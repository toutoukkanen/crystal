    <p class="report">Hello Thomson<br><br>
        I trust that you already know why you are here. I have some things to add.
        Your first task will be following Dr. Anand. He's an indian guy. Open minded and friendly, 
        one of our top scientists.
        He's not the kind to keep secrets from others and can't say no. 
        Evaluate him and dispose of him if necessary.<br><br>

        You will be equipped with a prototype called DP-M1. It's a pistol interpreter and a very effective one.
        It looks like other DP models but this one is special. It has the power of a cannon.
        If things get tough, don't hesitate to use that.<br><br>
        
        You will also have access to our special combat suit DA-M1. It can withstand a fucking rocket and still remain functional.
        It also has an integrated HUD in the helmet and a facial recognition system. I hope that it pleases your rather strict tastes.
