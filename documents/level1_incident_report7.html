        <i>Mikkola, COF</i><br>
        <b>5.7.2016</b><br><br>

        <b>5.7.2016 03:04</b> LAB n. four (4) was accessed by Prof. Jones.<br>
        At time residing derium equipment: eleven (11) DC-102, seven (7) DR-6, fifteen (15) DR-4, thirty (30) DP-22.<br>
        Subject authorization level: four (4).<br><br>
        

        <b>03:17</b><br>
        A severe explosion happened at the center of the fifty (50) square meter room. 
        The explosion melted an area of twenty (20) square meters and caused critical damage to all devices located in the room.
        The explosion shattered all blast proof windows and broke the 0.30 metre wide armored door in pieces.
        <br><br>
        

        <b>03:20</b><br>
        Security guard Thomas Wilson found the laboratory in an atrocious condition. When interrogated, Wilson described the events as horrifying.
        A strong smell that resembled that of a burning battery could be noted and Prof. Jones' body was found completely charred. At the time,
        some of the derium still leaked from the energy cells and formed crystals when it naturally stabilized.
        Derium leakage was also found on the surrounding walls which were partially covered in blue crystals formed from stabilized derium.        
        <br><br>

        <b>Further investigation</b><br>
        The explosion's cause was deemed to be an unprofessional handling of the derium equipment. The cause may also be a defection in one of the devices.
        All blast resistant windows were shattered which has raised great concern about the safety of the facility's laboratories.
        Overseer Crawford has issued an order to check all other laboratories for potential defective safety measures.
