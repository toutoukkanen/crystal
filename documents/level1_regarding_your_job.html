        Congratulations mister Brown! You are now officially one of us. You have been chosen to be one of our few database managers.
        Your job will be monitoring level 1 traffic. All the necessary tools will be on your desk and your collegues will help you with
        any problems.
        Keep an eye on things and report anything suspicious to your supervisor.
        I'm not saying that something might happen. We just have to be thorough if we want this facility to continue running.
        Gears should stay lubricated am I right?<br><br>

        <i>Crafword</i><br>
        <i>Overseer</i>
