    <p class="report">Welcome aboard!<br><br>
        Good to have you here. I wanted someone I can trust. I have placed you inside clearance level 3 so there would
        be no suspicion about our relationship. 
        Of course your special access card will allow you to go wherever you want.<br><br>

        There have been many misconducts of data security. Multiple files of our highly classified experiments
        have become completely open for some of our employees. This can't be just a system fault.
        There might be someone involved in this incident.<br><br>

        You work direcly under me and Mikkola, the Chief Of Security.
        Speak to people, gain their trust and pretend to be just another friendly security guard.
        In the meantime, look for rats. You know what I mean.
        Find any one who just might happen to know too much.
        Bring any potential suspect to interrogation and elimination.<br><br>

        I know that you only want action but Dr. Jones was killed in an explosion recently in LAB 4.
        Much of our equipment were destroyed.
        I know that you two were close.
