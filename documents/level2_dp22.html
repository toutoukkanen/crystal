        <b>Description</b><br>
        DP-22 is a unique derium interpreter. It behaves almost like a traditional interpretor but with some
        changes. Its unique logic board is tuned
        to execute small SPELLs at a fast pace. DP-22 has been designed to match the shape of an
        ordinary pistol. This makes DP-22 very ideal for military purposes.<br><br>

        The SPELL magazine's maximum capacity is four (4) terabytes. This is enough to have clear variation between the spells.<br><br>

        DP-22 has to have a compatible energy source. Only derium capacitors of model DC-70 and above are allowed.

        <br><br><br>
        <b>Differences from the predecessors</b><br>
        Energy input port is now parallel to the SPELL magazine. 
        This makes weapon handling easier and more comfortable for long time use.
