        <i>Dr. Anand</i><br><br>

        We really succeeded. I still can't believe it. We can change the world with derium.
        Jones was demonstrating to the team how he could cast magic with it.<br><br>
         
        The SPELL-system,
        it makes it feel like that it was actual magic. He casted a floating orb coated with deep blue
        fascinating flames. He made it glide smoothly in the air with just a flick of his finger.
        I know that he used the interpreter glove to compute derium commands but still it looked so real.
        It was beautiful, it was so beautiful.
        The energy, I can feel it vibrating at the hearts of our machines.
        It was like god had given this to us. Like this was the revealing we had long hoped for.
