        <b>Description</b><br>
        DC-102 is a derium capacitor made to store derium matter. 
        DC-102 uses the already known torus like design to keep derium flowing inside the superconductors.
        <br><br>

        DC-102 uses the derium colliding principle to keep acquiring more derium than it loses through thermodynamic
        balancing. When derium moves at a speed high enough and collides with other derium particles, it can briefly
        open a connection to the [REDACTED]. This makes derium particles harness energy enough that it can sustain itself.
        Practically this means that the capacity can always be restored while there is at least 5 cm^3 volume of derium matter.
        <br><br>

        <b>Differences from the predecessors</b><br>
        Titanium reinforced outer layer and type SC-2 superconductors have removed the need of additional supporting structures.
        The previous models had practically unneeded flow pipes which could hinder the user's ability to move effectively.
        This change makes the capacitor sitting more easily on the user's arm.
        In addition, non superformatting electromagnetic fields can be used to propel derium from the outputs.
